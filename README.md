**Development of Processing and Analysis Tools for Autonomous Vehicle Sensor Data**

Sets(Scene Extraction at large) is a data management and machine learning platform where one can store and organize their autonomous vehicle sensor dataset and deploy their machine learning/Deep learning models to test , validate and benchmark. The AV datasets are challenging regarding their size and varieties. For building strong and accurate models around this data is challenging. There should be methods to find out efficient test cases to validate different models according to their objective. Here is the use case of a data managing platform. 

We built algorithms to estimate the position , velocity , time to collision and acceleration of vehicles from the sensor readings. These vehicle attributes are essential in building various other functionalities in autonomous driving. ** EXPLAIN **

 Event identification is an another important task. Humans approach driving in a holistic fashion which entails, in particular, understanding road events and their evolution. For dataset management as well these algorithms are particularly useful. If you want to make a tailor-made test case for your algorithm , you might want to get a particular instance in the dataset. The vehicular attribute extractor and event identification will help in this matter. In matter of seconds these functionalities can return the instances in the whole dataset where a specific query matches. Queries can be like the following formats.

- Vehicle in next lane with a speed of more then 30 kmph
- An emergency vehicle  in front of the ego vehicle within a distance of 10 m.
- A vehicle overtaking ego vehicle through the wrong side.
